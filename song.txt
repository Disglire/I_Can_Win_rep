I had a dream once
All by myself with no one else
I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven
Then I woke up
And everybody wanted something
Reaching out, don't .... touch me
So I take pills to induce sleep
But I always wake up
Please, stay away from me
You keep on talking with nothing to say
I don't wanna hear about your life
You make me wanna eat a bullet, bullet
It's on my forehead, four letters off, and
Go forth and spread the word, I don't wanna know you
Please, stay away from me
'Cause I don't .... like you
